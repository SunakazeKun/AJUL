# Aurum's Java Utility Library
**Aurum's Java Utility Library**, or *AJUL* for short, is an open-source Java library providing methods and classes to handle common operations which are not covered by JRE. This library will be used in various projects of mine to delegate/outsource repeating and redundant code; new features will be sporadically included in this library. There will be no official releases meaning that you will have to include the *Apache Ant* project in your program's class path in order to use its features. If there are any issues, please report them to me. The code is distributed under the MIT license.

The Javadocs can be accessed on [my homepage](https://aurumsmods.com/javadoc/ajul/).
